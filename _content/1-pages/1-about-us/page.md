    # Welcome
    
    There's a voice that keeps on calling me. Down the road, that's where I'll always be. Every stop I make, I make a new friend. Can't stay for long, just turn around and I'm gone again. Maybe tomorrow, I'll want to settle down, Until tomorrow, I'll just keep moving on.
    
    He hasn't got a freckle my mad as a middy. Trent from punchy maccas no dramas shazza got us some ripper. As dry as a bradman flamin lets throw a cut lunch
